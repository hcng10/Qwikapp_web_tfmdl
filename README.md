# Qwikapp_web_tfmdl: Tensorflow Model on Qwikapp web

## Overview
This project consists of two dockerize components: LFT Detect and LFT Classify. Together, they provide a complete solution for processing lateral flow test (LFT) images. The detection component identifies and crops regions of interest within an LFT image, while the classification component categorizes these regions as 'invalid', 'negative', or 'positive'.
